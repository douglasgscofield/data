---------------------

Pith cell measurements from twigs of *Delonix regia*, nested within twig segment, branch, and individual tree.  An analysis of some of the data is provided in:


Scofield, DG. 2006. Medial pith cells per meter in twigs as a proxy for mitotic growth rate (&Phi;/m) in the apical meristem. *American Journal of Botany* **93**(12): 1740-1747. <http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.3732/ajb.93.12.1740>

These data are also available through DataDryad:

Scofield, DG.  2006. Data from: Medial pith cells per meter in twigs as a proxy for mitotic growth rate (&Phi;/m) in the apical meristem.  Dryad Digital Repository.  *Waiting on DataDryad approval and DOI assignment.*
